# MarcoSmiles v5.0 :musical_keyboard: :saxophone:
MarcoSmiles is a project born in 2016 within the Musimathics Laboratory of the University of Salerno that aims to realise new Human-Computer Interaction techniques for musical performances. 

In particular, by using a gesture recognition module to associate hand positions with musical notes, MarcoSmiles actually realises a virtual musical instrument.
